# reactive-cli-build

[Travis](https://travis-ci.org/lightbend/reactive-cli-build)

This project is used to build [reactive-cli](https://github.com/lightbend/reactive-cli) for [macOS](https://www.apple.com/macos). Because binaries built on macOS are only forward compatible (but not backwards), we leverage Travis' support for older versions, allowing us to ship binaries that work on a number of versions.
